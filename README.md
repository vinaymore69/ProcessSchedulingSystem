# ⏳ Process Scheduling System

## 🔰 Introduction
The **Process Scheduling System** is a web-based tool designed to simulate and visualize different CPU scheduling algorithms. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this application helps users understand how process scheduling works in operating systems.

## 🚀 Features
- **📊 Scheduling Algorithms**: Supports FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, and Priority Scheduling.
- **📉 Gantt Chart Visualization**: Displays process execution timeline.
- **🔢 Input Customization**: Users can enter their own process details.
- **⚡ Dynamic Calculations**: Computes waiting time, turnaround time, and response time.
- **🎨 Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile screens.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **📄 HTML**: Structure of the web application.
- **🎨 CSS**: Styling for an intuitive user interface.
- **⚡ JavaScript**: Implements scheduling algorithms and dynamic updates.

## 🏗️ Installation and Setup
### 📌 Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)

### 🔧 Steps to Run the Application
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/vinaymore69/ProcessSchedulingSystem.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd ProcessSchedulingSystem
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your preferred browser.
4. Start simulating CPU scheduling algorithms!

## 🎯 Usage
- Enter process details such as arrival time, burst time, and priority.
- Select a scheduling algorithm to execute the processes.
- View the Gantt chart and performance metrics.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- **📈 Additional Algorithms**: Add Multi-Level Queue and Multi-Level Feedback Queue.
- **📂 Data Persistence**: Save and load process data.
- **🔔 Real-Time Animations**: Improve the visualization of process execution.
